# Project Overview
This is a mine sweeper game. The purpose of the game is to guess where all of the mines are in a square grid without clicking on any of the mines. If you click on a mine, you lose.

Tkinter is used to create the GUI. A grid of buttons simulates a mine field and allows you to click on individual cells. 

# Play the Game
Copy this repository locally and run main.py. The GUI will pop up and the screen will have directions on how to play the game. Good luck!
